I am a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have a keen interest in open-source software development and have contributed to various projects on GitHub. I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and have experience working with Javascript-based Frameworks and Libraries. I am excited about the opportunity to work on the Electron Forge documentation migration project and contribute to the Electron community.

If selected for this project, I am committed to dedicating the required time and effort to ensure the successful completion of the project within the stipulated timeline. I can put in approximately 30-35 hours per week on this project and am open to discussions, feedback, and collaboration with the Electron team and the project mentor. If needed, I am willing to adjust my schedule to accommodate meetings, reviews, and other project-related activities. I m completely flexible with the project timeline and can adjust my schedule as per the project requirements.

## Project Abstract

The project aims to migrate the existing Electron Forge documentation from GitBook to Docusaurus, aligning it with the core Electron documentation setup. This migration will improve documentation management, accessibility, and user experience for developers working with Electron Forge.

## Why I chose this project?

I chose this project with the sole intention of getting to know the people of the open-source community and to contribute to the Electron project. As a developer, I understand the importance of well-structured and accessible documentation. I believe that migrating the Electron Forge documentation to Docusaurus will enhance the user experience and make it easier for developers to work with Electron Forge. I am excited about the opportunity to work on this project and contribute to the Electron community.

This would be my gateway to the electron community. Post this project i would like to pick up more challenging tasks and contribute to the electron project.

## Proposed Project Flow

- **Week 1:** Familiarize myself with the Electron Forge documentation structure and the Docusaurus documentation setup. Also reach out to the community and the project mentor to discuss the project requirements and expectations.

- **Week 2:** Start the migration process by setting up the Docusaurus documentation site and creating the necessary pages, components, and styles. Begin migrating the existing Electron Forge documentation content to the Docusaurus site. Review the progress with the project mentor and the community.

- **Week 3:** Post the initial migration, review the content structure, formatting, and styling to ensure consistency and readability. Design a plugin to integrate the TypeDoc API docs for Electron Forge into the Docusaurus site.

- **Week 4:** Implement the plugin to fetch and display the TypeDoc API documentation for Electron Forge in the Docusaurus site. Test the integration and make necessary adjustments to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Conclusion

I am excited about the opportunity to work on the Electron Forge documentation migration project and contribute to the Electron community. I am confident in my technical skills and ability to deliver high-quality work within the stipulated timeline. I am looking forward to collaborating with the Electron team, the project mentor, and the community to ensure the successful completion of the project. Thank you for considering my proposal, and I am eager to contribute to the Electron project.

> **Note:** My main focus is to develop the `TypeDoc API documentation plugin` for Electron Forge in the Docusaurus site. The video above is a representation of the work done so far and I am confident that i can complete the original project( migration of the gitbook docs to docusaurus) well before the stipulated timeline. Post the completion of the original project, I would like to work on the plugin development and integration, for which i will require mentorship from the Electron team.
